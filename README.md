# KrishAI – Machine Learning Module

This repository contains the **machine learning components** developed for the *KrishAI* project.

My contribution focused on:
- integrating external datasets,
- preparing ML-ready data through ETL scripts,
- and exploratory model development.

The backend and frontend were developed separately by other team members.
